v13.4 - En Passant capture is fully functional including clearing the pawns EP variables at the end
			of the current player's turn. << B. Fisher 2/28 2100

v13.5 - check function passed initial testing. Captured pieces need to be removed 
			from Player pieces array << B. Fisher 3/1 0330

v14.3 - Moved capture functionality to the Player object. Pieces are now removed from the array on capture.
			Check function is working. Added Checkmate (comments only) and Stalemate function (untested). << B. Fisher 3/03 2200

v14.4 - Modified check function to return checking pieces. << B. Fisher 3/04 0300

v14.5 - Added skipKing option to the check function to prevent recursion over the Legal function.
			Legal is removing threatened squares from the kings legal moves. Still doesn't recognize protected pieces.
			Started adding movePiece functionality into the Piece.move() function. << B. Fisher 3/04 1930

v15.4 - Resolved pinned against king issues except when the pinning piece captures the pinner << B. Fisher 3/07 2115
